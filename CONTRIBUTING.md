That's awesome 👏! Check out [`good first issues`](https://github.com/coderaiser/putout/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22),
most likely you can do some contribution using web interface, otherwise worry not 😏.

Make fork of a repo, clone it and run:

```
cd putout
npm install
npm run bootstrap
```

No matter what `package` you are interested in, you always have 4 little friends:

- 🦊 `lint`
- 🐺 `fix:lint`
- 🦏 `test`
- 🦛 `coverage`

You can call them from each package with `npm run` and they will always come 🤙.

## 🤷 How to check if my changes do not break anything?

When your made changes, added coverage and your package is ready for publishing 📦 , run: `npm run fresh`,
in the root of the repository, it will run `lint` and `test` over all `packages`.

## 🤷 What if I'm adding new plugin?

When adding new plugin, add it to [`package.json`](https://github.com/coderaiser/putout/blob/master/packages/putout/package.json) and [`putout.json`](https://github.com/coderaiser/putout/blob/master/packages/putout/putout.json).
Update [`Built-in Transformations`](https://github.com/coderaiser/putout#built-in-transformations) and [`Plugins`](https://github.com/coderaiser/putout#plugins-1).

## 🤷 How to name commit?
